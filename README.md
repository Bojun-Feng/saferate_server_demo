# SerenAIze - Using Machine Learning to Generate ASMR

Not getting enough of your favorite trigger sounds? Searched all over Youtube but can't find anymore than the precious 30 seconds you already have? Say goodbye to these problems - with the power of Machine Learning!

SerenAIze is an AI-powered tool that generates Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) audio. It uses machine learning models to generate relaxing and calming audio stimuli to help users fall asleep, reduce stress and anxiety, and improve their overall well-being.

## Important Note
The project has just started. We plan to release the first usable prototype before April.

## Features
- ASMR audio generated in real-time
- Customizable audio length
- Easy-to-use interface that requires no technical knowledge

## How it works
SerenAIze uses a model trained on thousands of ASMR audio snippets to generate new, unique audio triggers on demand. The model has been fine-tuned to generate high-quality audio stimuli that mimics the effects of real-life ASMR videos.

## Support
